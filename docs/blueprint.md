## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong purple (#A674F8) to convey a futuristic and creative feel. This color balances sophistication with a hint of technological advancement.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2B2D31) to maintain a modern, "dark mode" aesthetic. Its desaturation ensures that the color recedes to the background, allowing content to stand out. 
- Accent color: Electric blue (#63E2FF). Used sparingly for highlights, call-to-action buttons, and interactive elements. Its brightness will contrast well against the dark background and purple primary.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif; for a techy and modern feel. For body text: 'Inter' sans-serif; for a clean and readable style.
- Use a set of minimalist icons with a futuristic design style, sourced from a consistent icon set.
- Ensure a clear, intuitive layout, making it very easy for users to quickly generate content and saving time.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback, improve usability, and guide users through complex processes.
